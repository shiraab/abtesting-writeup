      <p>What differentiates a designer from an artist? Many people have written
        at length about this dilemma, but one crucial difference is their goals:
        design is unique in that it often has a specific <i>objective</i>, and therefore
        a crucial part of design is evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>How do you know if a design is successful, or if you've reached your goal? One way
        to evaluate a design is by comparing it to another. Comparative design evaluation is
        called an <b>A/B Test</b>, and it represents a major way in which designs and layouts
        are evaluated! An A/B test is actually part of the method of an experiment – it's the way
        we understand if a hypothesis – namely, a design decision – has any significant effect on user
        behavior.

      <p>I did an A/B test on a mock cactus e-commerce site. There are a few crucial actions that users
        may take while navigating the site: clicking on one of four buttons to add a specific cactus set
        to their cart, navigating to their cart, or returning to the main commerce page.
      </p>
      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>How does <b>differentiation of discrete products</b> affect user behavior? I define differentiation
        as the use of borders and backgrounds to set one product apart from another.</p>
      <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
      <p>Users will display less time to completion and a lower return rate upon introduction of rounded borders and semi-transparent
        white backgrounds. Namely, the design with borders and backgrounds will perform better than the design
        without borders or backgrounds.
      </p>
      <h3>Summary of process</h3>
      <p>Using some complex routing, users were shown either the A or B version and instructed to fill their carts
        with $150 worth of cacti.
      </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>

      </div>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This was an interesting way to evaluate a website – even if the results
        are inconclusive!</p>
